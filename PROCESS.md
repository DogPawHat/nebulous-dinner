Process so far

0. Set up development envrionment (Usually use Arch Linux with Visual Studio Code and zsh shell)
1. Get `create-react-app` installed and create app with `react-scripts-ts` (I prefer to use TypeScript)
2. Install `emotion` and `react-emotion` for css-in-js (I tend to subscribe to the notion that components are better styling construcitosn then css classes and emotion is a good way to implement that)
3. Set up `@storybook\react` for a nice UI development envionment
4. Relise I can't open the .skech file because of lack of access to a mac, so get an account on figma.com to view the Sketch app so I can extract the css
